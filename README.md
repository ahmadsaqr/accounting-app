# accounting-app
please read the documentation to have an idea




-i made this little app by applying my programming knowladge from  php.


-this app only for my company and summrize how to divide cash.


-demo data has been set and it show three differnet cases on [wages sheet].
 

-it keep sales coming from [cash,etpos, and online Banking],
 record timesheets and calculate the wages.


-before calculating the down mentioned, it will take into account other wages and cash withdwal made by any of business partner, so the left cash would called cash availabe.  


-now there is three cases:-
[

 "cash available < zero" : 
                       "Payable Wages",

 "cash available > zero  && cash available < netwage" :
			"Take $ and payable",

 "cash available > zero  && cash available > netwage" :
                        "take $ and Each earn" 

]
